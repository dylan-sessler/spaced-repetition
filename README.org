** DONE Background
   CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 21:05]
When you learn something you encode the information as a *phsyical*
structure. It takes up space. It requires nutrients and energy to maintain. An
average brain consumes about 20% of your daily intake of calories per day. It's
because of this that your brain has self-cleaning process to keep it as slim and
efficient as it possibly can be - it's called *forgetting*. 

The world our brains evolved in was very different than it is today. We needed
to get food and reproduce and react really fast to danger. Today, we're knowledge workers. We create value in the complex and
abstract. We spend much more of our mental energy on future possibilities rather than
current dangers, and depending on your specific field there are many orders of magnitude of performance increases
available for making more optimal decisions. What prevents you from accessing
these higher value solutions is your current physical information structures' limited
experiences and knowledge.

To upgrade ourselves, we learn. We read books, compare best practices, scour the
internet, go to conventions, make mistakes, and ask eachother for feedback. And
as we're spending huge amounts of our time collecting new information and
experiences we're constantly *forgetting*. This is a huge waste of our efforts
and time spent learning and amounts to a *loss of 75% of the material learned
within 48 hours* with more decay happening with every passing hour.

Forgetting is a natural process and it also has a natural solution. Everyone
reading this article already knows what it is: *practice*.

When we *re-stimulate* an information structure we have at some point learned, we allocate more resources to
reinforcing it. It becomes more *durable*, and will be probabilistically less
likely to be eradicated by our forgetting algorithm. 

So why don't we practice more? Because we don't have *a system for practicing what we've learned efficiently*.
** DONE Intro
   CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 21:11]
A Spaced Repetition System (*SRS*) optimizes the process of practicing what you
have learned in order to prevent forgetting. It does so in two ways:
- It relies on *active recall* rather than *passive study*. This creates more
  durable knowledge structures.
- It computes optimum intervals that should separate reviews of knowledge. This
  takes advantage of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect][the spacing effect]], ensuring that you get the highest available increase in knowledge durability
  for your time.
 
It is typically facilitated with software in order to enable users to maintain
vast knowledge collections, sometimes spanning tens and thousands of items, at a
cost of a few minutes per day. 

It takes about 30 seconds to add a piece of knowledge to a Spaced Repetition
System and about 110 seconds of practice to maintain that knowledge for the rest
of your lifetime. Knowing these costs you can come to the following conclusions:
- If at any point in your life you will ever need access to the knowledge again
  (eg. googling it, checking notes, etc), even just once, you will save yourself time by storing
  it in your SRS and being able to recall it on demand. 
  - In addition to the saved time, this also has the added compounding benefit
    of preventing you from having to leave a flow state in order to
    seek out the knowledge.
- If over the course of your lifetime you expect to gain or prevent the loss of your
  (hourly-pay-rate/30) (eg. $50/hr would come out to $1.67) of increased value
  from having access to that knowledge, you should store it in your SRS.

This is the most efficient solution I've found to solve for the problem of forgetting. 
** DONE Process 
   CLOSED: [2020-11-14 Sat 12:50]
The process of implementing a Spaced Repetition System is simple. You need to do
two things:
- Add Knowledge
- Practice Knowledge
*** Add knowledge you want to maintain to your SRS 
The process of adding knowledge to your SRS is a process of formatting the
knowledge for efficient *active recall*. This is done through 
*occlusion*: hiding some of the information in order to make your actively
challenge your brain fill in the blank. 
**** Text Occlusions a.k.a. Cloze Deletions
Check out the [[https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/editing?id=cloze-deletion][Anki Docs on Cloze Deletion]] for good examples and explanations.

These will be the most common type of knowledge you will add to your SRS. When
creating a cloze deletion, you want to keep the following in mind:
***** Provide Adequate Context
The text that is not occluded is the /context/ of your knowledge. Try to make
this context match the context the knowledge will be useful in wherever possible.

When creating cloze deletions, keep in mind that the card will pop up in a
random order with the rest of your knowledge. If something you are learning is
domain specific (eg. to a specific programming language), mention that at the
start of the cloze deletion to trigger the right parts of your brain to fire in
response to seeing the information 

#+BEGIN_CENTER
*In Javascript*, hyphens [are | are not] allowed in variable names
#+END_CENTER
***** Match Occlusion to Desired Implementation
When deciding what to occlude, think about the implementation of the
knowledge and try to match that as closely as possible. 

For example, let's say you're trying to program a healthy response to feeling in a
funk in yourself. You could start out with the sentence:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When you're in a funk, do something that will make you feel just a little bit better.
#+END_QUOTE

What should we occlude here? The answer becomes obvious when you think about
the implementation. When we are in a funk, we want to take a specific
action. Being in a funk is the context, doing something that will make you
feel better is the action. In the real world, when we identify that we're in a
funk, we want the response to be to take the action of doing something that
will make us feel a little bit better. This can be trained by occluding as
follows:

#+BEGIN_CENTER
When you're in a funk, do something that will [...]
#+END_CENTER

Occluding the opposite way wouldn't make any sense for /what we are trying to acheive/.

#+BEGIN_CENTER
When you're [...], do something that will make you feel just a little bit better. 
#+END_CENTER

The trigger of the desired action is being in a funk, not doing something that
will make you feel just a little bit better.
**** Image Occlusions
Image occlusions are not part of the stock Anki experience, but are incredibly
valuable. Much of our knowledge is better expressed as an image rather than
text and this is a tool that allows you to do that.

I would highly recommend installing this right away by following the linked
instructions below:

- [[https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1111933094][Image Occlusion Add-On]]
**** Final Thoughts
Formulating knowledge efficiently /for your experience/ is a skill you will
build over time. Don't worry about being perfect, you can always edit knowledge
that is poorly formulated when it comes up in review. 

Remember, that it only costs 110 seconds to retain the knowledge for the rest of
your life - you shouldn't be spending more than 30 seconds on the formulation of
that knowledge! There's a lot to learn and you don't need to be perfect with
this - just jump in and figure it out over time :)

We cover more best practices of [[*FormulatingKnowledge][Formulating Knowledge]] later on. 
*** Review the knowledge your SRS has scheduled for you every day
If you miss a day or a few, it's fine. Don't worry about it. It will be
slightly less efficient and you'll have a bit of a backlog but the important
thing is you get back into the habit of maintaining.
** DONE The Tools
   CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 21:18]
*** Anki
Anki is the SRS I currently use and is the one we will be using to demonstrate
today. It has the following notable traits.
- [PLUS] Free and Open Source (FOSS)
- [PLUS] Cross platform (Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android) 
  - note: The iOS app is not FOSS. It costs $25 and isn't quite as good as the
    android version but will do fine. Let's be real, if you have apple products
    you can afford the $25 to maintain everything you learn for the rest of your life.
- [MINUS] default settings suck, they will make you spend about double the time you
  actually need (my recommendations below)
- [MINUS] The Spaced Repetition Anki employs is a slightly modified version of
  the open sourced SM-2 (SuperMemo-2) algorithm from 1990. It's simple and effective, but
  there are better algorithms out there for the core of your SRS. 
*** Supermemo 
Supermemo was my first SRS and is a much more powerful tool than Anki. The lead
developer, Piotr Wozniak, was the orignal creator of Spaced Repetition Systems and he has
devoted his life to building out an incredibly powerful, but admittedly
idiosyncratic SRS. He has (self)-published an [[https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru][an incredible amount of work]] on the
topics of learning, memory, and sleep. 

It has the following notable traits:
- [PLUS] SM-18 algorithm - consistently and obsessively optimized over the last
  30 years by the father of spaced repetition. 
- [PLUS] Built-in [[https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading][Incremental Learning]] workflow
  - This is the only effective tool I've found at implementing a solid
    incremental learning workflow, which is by far the most efficient method of
    processing text, video, images from first read -> active-recalls.
- [MINUS] Windows Only - This means no SRS while you poop :(
- [MINUS] Closed Source - You are totally reliant on the developer having built
  something for you to use it. Some workflows and keybindings are really
  idiosyncratic and you'll wish that someone could have built a plug-in to let
  you customize it. 
- [NEUTRAL] [[https://www.help.supermemo.org/wiki/Features][This tool is massive.]] In addition to incremental learning and SRS,
  it features a sleep analysis tool, a time management tool, a schedule planner,
  and even an incremental email client. You can go really deep and spend years
  learning how to leverage this tool more effectively and it can be a bit
  intimidating to new users. Expect to learn the tool incrementally and you'll
  be fine. 

Ultimately, I would prefer to be using Supermemo as it's a much more powerful
tool for a very important job. However the friction created from the tool being closed source and
windows was worse for me than the performance loss from switching to Anki.
*** Other Tools
Above are the only two SRSes that I have experience with and are by far the most
popular. There are others being developed currently that a quick google search
will reveal.

Use the defaults at the peril of your own wasted time. Below are the settings I

curious. Changing these settings will result in a roughly 50% cost reduction in daily
maintenance time over your lifetime at an imperceptible loss to retention.

**** The Deeper Dive Into Options
In order to determine the effect of different default settings on the cost of
maintaining a knowledge collection I built an [[https://jsfiddle.net/qkt08dfn/3/][Anki Scheduler Simulator]] and
compared behavior of the Anki SM-2 algorithm from the 1990s to my experience
using the modern SM-18 algorithm in supermemo. 

As you use the tool, you can continue to optimize further by [[*Optimizing your Learning Interval][Optimizing your Learning Interval]],
but the above settings are a great place to get started.
***** New Cards Options Explained
| Option                                 | Default Value | More Efficient Value       |
|----------------------------------------+---------------+----------------------------|
| New Cards -> Steps                     | 1 10          | 1440                       |
| New Cards -> Graduating Interval       | 1             | 5                          |

The default settings in Anki assume that you are learning something new for the
very first time in the Anki app (hence the default values of showing the new
card within 1 minute, and then in 10 minutes). This is an antipattern to efficient and
cohesive knowledge formation, and breaks the first "rule" that we discuss later
on [[*Do not learn if you do not understand][Do not learn if you do not understand]].  

By the time you have loaded a piece of knowledge into the SRS you should
have already had a meaningful exposure, creating a non-trivial amount of memory
durability. Because of this, you don't need as many early exposures and this can
save significantly on lifetime cost of knowledge maintenance.

Using my settings, by the time you review a card for the 11th time you will have
a review interval of over 50 years (and have already maintained the knowledge
for ~40 years). At a cost of 10 seconds per review (pretty conservative), this
means that each piece of knowledge will cost 110 seconds to maintain for the
rest of your life. 

The beginning of the default Anki settings scheduling progression looks like
this:
- 1 minute from creation 
- 10 minutes from last review
- 1 day from last review 
- 2.5 days from last review
- 5 days from last review
- 12 days from last review
- etc...

With my recommended settings:
- 1 day from creation
- 5 days from review 
- 12 days from last review

As you can see this shaves off three reviews from the early learning process
which is really important for two reasons:
1) This is a 27% reduction to lifetime knowledge maintenance costs. This
   improves the value:cost of using your SRS significantly. 
2) This is a 50% reduction to early review costs. When you are actively learning
   something new, your daily review load will increase a lot as the majority of
   the time spent reviewing is front-loaded to the beginning of the maintenance
   period. A 50% reduction to early review costs effectively makes it so that
   you can learn twice as fast for the same cost of early retention (which is
   most of the work).

The reason not to reduce the early learning load would be if the retention rate
dropped to an unacceptable level during this period. I have not found this to be
the case for way I formulate my knowledge but your milage may vary depending on
how you use your SRS. Using my settings my current retention rate on Young Cards
(defined as between 1 and 21 days old) is 99.15%, strongly suggesting that I should actually be reviewing *less frequently* in the
early stages. 

Setting the cadence of review is controlled using the Steps and Graduating
Interval options. 

The Easy Interval is a feature I don't really use as I prefer [[*Simple Recall Grading][Simple Recall Grading]],
but if you were going to use it you should have the Easy interval be at least as
long as the Graduating Interval.

Bury New related cards is useful for multi-occlusion cards, which makes it so
that you are spacing your reviews of very similar topics further apart in order
to get more value from the review.

I find these settings to be incredibly irresponsible and destructive, and
left un-changed will render Anki an unusable application for long-term SRS with
even moderate workloads. When people switch from Anki -> Supermemo, this is the
main reason why. 

The two above settings mean that when you answer that you did not recall the
information correctly, Anki will show the knowledge to you again in 10 minutes
AND Anki will reset your interval on the card to 1 day. 

This means that if you have a card that was 5 years between reviews, and
you happened to not be able to access the information *one time*, it would reset to showing you at 1 day, then 2.5
days, then 6.25 days, etc.

As you can expect, when you have something that you have reviewed enough times
to be on a 5 year interval, you have already built a good amount of mental
structure around the item in long-term storage, you just may have at that
individual moment due to fatigue or a haphazard access trace being culled in
your brain not been able to recall. However, with the re-exposure and re-stimulation it's highly
likely that the stability of that memory would be solidly retained and having to
re-progress through all the reviews would be highly inefficient.

IMO, this should be set to at least 100%, to retain the same interval, and
modern-day data-driven supermemo algorithm would dictate that it should be set to roughly the
same length of time as the card would have been set to if it was answered "good"
(default 250%).

I find this especially troubling, considering that in a proper spaced repetition
system you should never have a 100% recall rate as the amount of time taken in
order to ensure a higher recall rate increases exponentially with the target
recall rate that you are shooting for. In reality, there are very few sets of
knowledge that you need to retain near 100% recall-ability of. Supermemo
defaults to a setting next showing ratios to a 90% recall rate threshold, and
Anki parrots this as the typical default ideal for a collection.

What's insane about this is that Anki is expecting that you will be answer that
you were not able to recall the information on 10% of your cards, and its default behavior is to reset a card to a 1
day interval. This means that every review session, 10% of your cards will
essentially become brand new again and over time it will be impossible to keep
up with maintaining your collection. This is actually insane and makes no
sense. Just because you have a momentary lapse in recall that doesn't mean all
structures relating to the information in your brain have been eliminated! We
observe this regularly when we re-learn something and it is much easier to learn
the first time. This is a HUGE design flaw in the efficiency of the application
in supporting lifetime learning.

Compare this to Supermemo, where due to the consistent exponential delay
increases ensure that your daily review load will be mostly set by the rate of
new cards being added to your collection, not also exponentionall growing based
on the sized of your collection.

Based on running the [[https://jsfiddle.net/j1v4ym2z/9/][Anki Schedule Simulator]], just by changing the Lapses -> New
Interval setting from 0% -> 100% it results in a 50% reduction in the amount of
time needed to maintain your collection. Ideally this could be set to 250% (or
whatever your default ease is set to) and is likely something I will build a
plugin for at some point.

Eliminating the 10 minute after lapse review will also reduce cost of knowledge
maintanance by ~10%.

** TODO Useful Add-Ons
** TODO Optimizing your Learning Interval
The amount of effort it takes to maintain a knowledge retention rate increases
exponentially the closer it gets to 100%. Eg) it takes a lot less work to
increase retention from 85% -> 90% than it does from 90% -> 95%. In general,
users of SRS target a 90% retention rate, which means that 90% of the time they
remembered the active recall prompt, and 10% of the time they could not recall
the prompt.

Since this is the retention rate at time of recall and the average card in your
collection will be halfway between just reviewed and the next time of recall,
your actual retention rate for your knowledge collection will be roughly equal
to  100%-(100%-targetRetentionRate)/2. In our case of targeting 90%, your
average recall across your collection at any point in time in your life will be
95%.

This is adequate for most users and is a good balance of value:cost. This is
also something you can tweak.
