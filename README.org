*** Value
- Guarantee a 95% LIFETIME retention rate on learned material
- Reduce barriers to flow in complex, creative work
- Never need to re-learn anything again
*** Cost
- 2 hours set-up 
- 1-15 minutes/day maintenance (do this while pooping)
- 30 seconds per item you want to remember to format for SRS

More accurately, you could define the cost as:
- 2 hours set-up
- 140 seconds (LIFETIME) per item you want to remember (LIFETIME) 
  - 30 seconds formatting for SRS 
  - 110 seconds of lifetime maintenance

   CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 21:05]
When you learn something you encode the information as a *phsyical*
structure. It takes up space. It requires nutrients and energy to maintain. An
average brain consumes about 20% of your daily intake of calories per day. It's
because of this that your brain has self-cleaning process to keep it as slim and
efficient as it possibly can be - it's called *forgetting*. 

The world our brains evolved in was very different than it is today. We needed
to get food and reproduce and react really fast to danger. Today, we're knowledge workers. We create value in the complex and
abstract. We spend much more of our mental energy on future possibilities rather than
current dangers, and depending on your specific field there are many orders of magnitude of performance increases
available for making more optimal decisions. What prevents you from accessing
these higher value solutions is your current physical information structures' limited
experiences and knowledge.

To upgrade ourselves, we learn. We read books, compare best practices, scour the
internet, go to conventions, make mistakes, and ask eachother for feedback. And
as we're spending huge amounts of our time collecting new information and
experiences we're constantly *forgetting*. This is a huge waste of our efforts
and time spent learning and amounts to a *loss of 75% of the material learned
within 48 hours* with more decay happening with every passing hour.

Forgetting is a natural process and it also has a natural solution. Everyone
reading this article already knows what it is: *practice*.

When we *re-stimulate* an information structure we have at some point learned, we allocate more resources to
reinforcing it. It becomes more *durable*, and will be probabilistically less
likely to be eradicated by our forgetting algorithm. 

So why don't we practice more? Because we don't have *a system for practicing what we've learned efficiently*.
** DONE Intro
   CLOSED: [2020-11-11 Wed 21:11]
A Spaced Repetition System (*SRS*) optimizes the process of practicing what you
have learned in order to prevent forgetting. It does so in two ways:
- It relies on *active recall* rather than *passive study*. This creates more
  durable knowledge structures.
- It computes optimum intervals that should separate reviews of knowledge. This
  takes advantage of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacing_effect][the spacing effect]], ensuring that you get the highest available increase in knowledge durability
  for your time.
 
It is typically facilitated with software in order to enable users to maintain
vast knowledge collections, sometimes spanning tens and thousands of items, at a
cost of a few minutes per day. 

It takes about 30 seconds to add a piece of knowledge to a Spaced Repetition
System and about 110 seconds of practice to maintain that knowledge for the rest
of your lifetime. Knowing these costs you can come to the following conclusions:
- If at any point in your life you will ever need access to the knowledge again
  (eg. googling it, checking notes, etc), even just once, you will save yourself time by storing
  it in your SRS and being able to recall it on demand. 
  - In addition to the saved time, this also has the added compounding benefit
    of preventing you from having to leave a flow state in order to
    seek out the knowledge.
- If over the course of your lifetime you expect to gain or prevent the loss of your
  (hourly-pay-rate/30) (eg. $50/hr would come out to $1.67) of increased value
  from having access to that knowledge, you should store it in your SRS.

This is the most efficient solution I've found to solve for the problem of forgetting. 
** TODO Process 
The process of implementing a Spaced Repetition System is simple. You need to do
two things:
*** Add knowledge you want to maintain to your SRS 
*** Review the knowledge your SRS has scheduled for you every day
If you miss a day or a few, it's fine. Don't worry about it. It will be
slightly less efficient and you'll have a bit of a backlog but the important
thing is you get back into the habit of maintaining.
** DONE The Tools
   CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 21:18]
*** Anki
Anki is the SRS I currently use and is the one we will be using to demonstrate
today. It has the following notable traits.
- [PLUS] Free and Open Source (FOSS)
- [PLUS] Cross platform (Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS, Android) 
  - note: The iOS app is not FOSS. It costs $25 and isn't quite as good as the
    android version but will do fine. Let's be real, if you have apple products
    you can afford the $25 to maintain everything you learn for the rest of your life.
- [MINUS] default settings suck, they will make you spend about double the time you
  actually need (my recommendations below)
- [MINUS] The Spaced Repetition Anki employs is a slightly modified version of
  the open sourced SM-2 (SuperMemo-2) algorithm from 1990. It's simple and effective, but
  there are better algorithms out there for the core of your SRS. 
*** Supermemo 
Supermemo was my first SRS and is a much more powerful tool than Anki. The lead
developer, Piotr Wozniak, was the orignal creator of Spaced Repetition Systems and he has
devoted his life to building out an incredibly powerful, but admittedly
idiosyncratic SRS. He has (self)-published an [[https://supermemo.guru/wiki/SuperMemo_Guru][an incredible amount of work]] on the
topics of learning, memory, and sleep. 

It has the following notable traits:
- [PLUS] SM-18 algorithm - consistently and obsessively optimized over the last
  30 years by the father of spaced repetition. 
- [PLUS] Built-in [[https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading][Incremental Learning]] workflow
  - This is the only effective tool I've found at implementing a solid
    incremental learning workflow, which is by far the most efficient method of
    processing text, video, images from first read -> active-recalls.
- [MINUS] Windows Only - This means no SRS while you poop :(
- [MINUS] Closed Source - You are totally reliant on the developer having built
  something for you to use it. Some workflows and keybindings are really
  idiosyncratic and you'll wish that someone could have built a plug-in to let
  you customize it. 
- [NEUTRAL] [[https://www.help.supermemo.org/wiki/Features][This tool is massive.]] In addition to incremental learning and SRS,
  it features a sleep analysis tool, a time management tool, a schedule planner,
  and even an incremental email client. You can go really deep and spend years
  learning how to leverage this tool more effectively and it can be a bit
  intimidating to new users. Expect to learn the tool incrementally and you'll
  be fine. 

Ultimately, I would prefer to be using Supermemo as it's a much more powerful
tool for a very important job. However the friction created from the tool being closed source and
windows was worse for me than the performance loss from switching to Anki.
*** Other Tools
Above are the only two SRSes that I have experience with and are by far the most
popular. There are others being developed currently that a quick google search
will reveal.

*** DONE Syncing Across Devices 
    CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 21:25]
You will want to be using Anki on multiple devices. Adding knowledge to your
collection is most effectively done on the desktop. Practicing knowledge can be
done just as efficiently on your phone and can turn pooping or any kind of
waiting into an incredibly productive activity.

    CLOSED: [2020-11-12 Thu 21:27]
Here's a link to the [[https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/][Anki Manual]]. You're going to hopefully be spending a
lifetime with this tool. Take the time to get to know it! 

I would highly recommend starting off your SRS knowledge collection with
important to remember or interesting knowledge from the manual itself!
*** TODO Default Settings
Use the defaults at the peril of your own wasted time. Below are the settings I
*STRONGLY* recommend along with explantations for those of you who are curious.

The settings I am talking about here are

** TODO Rules to be Successful
*** TODO Do not learn if you do not understand
The goal is not to be good at filling in the blank in sentences. The goal is to
re-stimuate valuable knowledge structures in your brain so you don't lose them. 
*** TODO Formulating Knowledge

** TODO Maximalist SRS
Here are some additional ways that you can utilize your SRS for profit.

** TODO Tips and Tricks
- Just answer "Good" or "Again" when evaluating a question. Don't stress about the decision of whether
  something was "Hard" or "Easy". It's unnecessary decision fatigue for minimal gains 
- Don't worry too much about formatting your knowledge. Keep it simple and
  remember that you can always edit it later if you don't like how it's
  formatted. Try to keep knowledge adding under 30 seconds per piece of knowledge.
** TODO Optimizing your Learning Interval
The amount of effort it takes to maintain a knowledge retention rate increases
exponentially the closer it gets to 100%. Eg) it takes a lot less work to
increase retention from 85% -> 90% than it does from 90% -> 95%. In general,
users of SRS target a 90% retention rate, which means that 90% of the time they
remembered the active recall prompt, and 10% of the time they could not recall
the prompt.

Since this is the retention rate at time of recall and the average card in your
collection will be halfway between just reviewed and the next time of recall,
your actual retention rate for your knowledge collection will be roughly equal
to  100%-(100%-targetRetentionRate)/2. In our case of targeting 90%, your
average recall across your collection at any point in time in your life will be
95%.

This is adequate for most users and is a good balance of value:cost. This is
also something you can tweak.
